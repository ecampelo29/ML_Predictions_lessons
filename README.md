# ML_Predictions_lessons
experimenting with ml prediction on python


In this first project i'll be working with a tradicional dataset to understand the steps of how to build a ml model based on sckit-learn api

My guide is the book "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow : Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems"
